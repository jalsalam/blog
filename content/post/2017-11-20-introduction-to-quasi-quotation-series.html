<p>Recently I have been spending time reading the <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/expressions">draft chapters</a> in the 2nd Edition Advanced-R book by Hadley Wickham – specifically the chapters about Expressions, Quotation, Evaluation, and Domain-Specific Languages. These chapters accompany new quasi-quotation and tidy evaluation tools provided in the <code>rlang</code> package. I am really excited about these tools. I think they will be very general and powerful tools for programming with dplyr and shiny, making higher-order functions, and I am excited to try out domain-specific language techniques. I have also read some skepticism about them being too complicated or difficult to understand, and so I wanted to make my own attempt to show why they are worth learning.</p>

<li>This post is an introduction to the series (so I can eliminate throat-clearing from the posts)</li>
<li>If you are having trouble picturing what is going on, I tried to develop an <a href="//posts/2017/quasi-quotation-as-meta-recipe/">Analogy for Quasi-Quotation</a> that might help with a mental model</li>
<li>If you are just looking to accomplish something, I wrote down some <a href="//posts/2017/quasi-quotation-applications/">Quasi-Quotation Applications</a></li>

<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>As a caveat, I am no expert in these tools. I’ve been using R for 2 years, but haven’t written lots of functions using these quotatino tools or anything. I have taught myself a lot about them in writing these posts, in fact! If you want the authoritative version, check out the vignette on <a href="http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html">programming in dplyr</a> and Advanced-R.</p>

<h3>Who Quasi-Quotation is For:</h3>
<p>There has been discussion about whether quasi-quotation and tidy evaluation tools are more for package authors than they are for people just trying to do some data wrangling. For me, understanding quasi-quotation has corresponded to a deeper understanding of how R works. This has been fun and valuable for me. That said, I understand that some people aren’t interested in that. I would recommend learning quasi-quotation to people who are already very comfortable writing functions and using higher-order functions like the <code>apply</code> and <code>purrr::map</code> families of functions. I think quasi-quotation tools have some similar features to higher-order functions (although more general).</p>

<h3>Something Old, Something New:</h3>
<p>I come to all of this through the tidyverse and the Advanced-R book. But R has always had quotation and meta-programming tools. I am unqualified to do a full comparison. For example, I’m not sure if base R has quasi-quotation features. I think that tidy evaluation with rlang provides something new, but again there are analogies to lisp and to the past. One big improvement in the R language versus S was giving R functions lexical scoping (<a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/lexical.pdf">see here</a>). I’m no expert, but it looks to me like <code>rlang::eval_tidy</code> gives R expressions (really quosures) lexical scoping as well.</p>
