<p>Recently I have been spending time reading the <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/expressions">draft chapters</a> in the 2nd Edition Advanced-R book by Hadley Wickham – specifically the chapters about Expressions, Quotation, Evaluation, and Domain-Specific Languages. These chapters accompany new quasi-quotation and tidy evaluation tools provided in the <code>rlang</code> package. I am really excited about these tools. I think they will be very useful for programming with dplyr and shiny, making higher-order functions, and I am excited to try out domain-specific language techniques. I have also read some skepticism about them being too complicated or difficult to understand, and so I wanted to make my own attempt to show why they are worth learning.</p>

<p>About Me:</p>
<p>As a caveat, I am no expert. I’ve been using R for 2 years, but haven’t written lots of functions using these quotatino tools or anything. I have taught myself a lot about them in writing these posts, in fact! If you want the authoritative version, check out the vignette on <a href="http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html">programming in dplyr</a> and Advanced-R.</p>
<p>Who Quasi-Quotation is For:</p>
<p>There has been discussion about whether quasi-quotation and tidy evaluation tools are more for package authors than they are for people just trying to do some data wrangling. For me, understanding quasi-quotation has corresponded to a deeper understanding of how R works. This has been fun and valuable for me. That said, I understand that may sound daunting to some people. I would recommend learning quasi-quotation to people who are already very comfortable writing functions and using the</p>
<p><em>This post is one of a series of posts that I am doing about expressions, quasi-quotation, and tidy evaluation. This post tries to establish a mental model for quasi-quotation. The <a href="/posts/2017/quasi-quotation-applications/">companion post</a> shows some useful things you can actually do with these tools.</em></p>
<p><em>The R language has a powerful set of features for manipulating expressions which has recently been extended by the tidyverse team in the rlang package. I am really excited about the power and generality of quasi-quotation, especially in the realms of higher-order functions and creating unique function APIs. That said, I would recommend R users feel very comfortable with functions and functional programming (e.g., <code>apply</code> and/or <code>map</code> families of functions) before attempting quasi-quotation.</em></p>
