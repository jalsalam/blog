_This post is one of a series of posts that I am doing about expressions, quasi-quotation, and tidy evaluation. This post shows some useful things you can actually do with these tools without attempting to explain what's going on. The [companion post](/posts/2017/quasi-quotation-as-meta-recipe/) tries to establish a mental model for quasi-quotation by analogy to a meta-recipe for cake._

So you've already made an initial attempt to learn quasi-quotation/tidy evaluation, and the hill to understanding these tools still looks high. You are asking "why bother?", and tempted to just stick with what you know until forced, kicking-and-screaming to do it the "new way." In the following I will try to provide some quick wins and also show a taste of the power of quasi-quotation.

## Recode LOTS of values, with Quasi-Quotation

Say you are doing some data cleaning and you decide to try out [`dplyr::recode`](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/recode.html). The examples in the documentation give a plausible way to change a couple of values:

```{r}
# Recode values with named arguments
x <- sample(c("a", "b", "c"), 10, replace = TRUE)
dplyr::recode(x, a = "Apple")
```

But wait -- do you really have to manually type in EVERY value that you want to replace?!?! Nope. You need to create a named list, and then use the `!!!` operator (pronounced 'bang bang bang' or unquote-splice).

```{r}
fruits <- list("Apple", "Banana", "Carrot")
fruit_lookup <- set_names(fruits, c("a", "b", "c"))

recode(x, !!!fruit_lookup)
```

Note: I think this used to work with a named character vector, but now `!!!`/`UQS()` only works with lists, so you make it a list. 

I find the term "splice" confusing -- something to do with DNA? I want to find an animation to demonstrate what splicing means, but I haven't found it yet. In the mean time, just know that you can pass a named list to `recode` lots of values. This was my first practical use of the `rlang` tools.
