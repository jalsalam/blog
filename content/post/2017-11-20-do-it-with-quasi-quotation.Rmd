_This post is one of a series of posts that I am doing about expressions, quasi-quotation, and tidy evaluation. This post shows some useful things you can actually do with these tools without attempting to explain what's going on. The [companion post](/posts/2017/quasi-quotation-as-meta-recipe/) tries to establish a mental model for quasi-quotation by analogy to a meta-recipe for cake._

So you've already made an initial attempt to learn quasi-quotation/tidy evaluation, and the hill to understanding these tools still looks high. You are asking "why bother?", and tempted to just stick with what you know until forced, kicking-and-screaming to do it the "new way." In the following I will try to provide some quick wins and also show a taste of the power of quasi-quotation.

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("tidyverse"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("rlang"))
```


## 1) Recode LOTS of values, with Quasi-Quotation

My first practical use of these tools was to apply a large number of replacements with `recode`. If you are only replacing a couple of values, it is easy to type the replacements into the `recode` call:

```{r}
# Recode values with named arguments
x <- sample(c("a", "b", "c"), 10, replace = TRUE)
dplyr::recode(x, a = "Apple")
```

But wait -- do you really have to manually type in EVERY value that you want to replace?!?! Nope. You need to create a named list, and then use the `!!!` operator (pronounced 'bang bang bang' or unquote-splice).

```{r}
fruits <- list("Apple", "Banana", "Carrot")
fruit_lookup <- set_names(fruits, c("a", "b", "c"))

recode(x, !!!fruit_lookup)
```

It needs to be a named list (not a vector) because `UQS()`/`!!!` just works on lists. For the purpose of the example I wrote out the lookup, but its easy to make it from a dataframe, for example like:

```{r}
fruit_lookup2 <- set_names(fruits, str_to_lower(str_sub(fruits, 1, 1))) %>% as.list()
```


## 2) Don't Repeat Yourself, with Quasi-Quotation

In the course of a data analysis script, I frequently find myself doing repeated group-by operations by the same or a similar set of variables several times. If I add a variable to the main dataset early on, I then have to update the list of group-by variables in many places.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("tidyverse"))

mpg2 <- mpg %>%
  group_by(class, manufacturer, model) %>%
  mutate(max_cty = max(cty),
         max_hwy = max(hwy)) %>%
  ungroup()

# ....

mpg3 <- mpg2 %>%
  group_by(class, manufacturer, model) %>%
  mutate(mpg_ratio = hwy / cty) %>%
  ungroup()

# ...

mpg4 <- mpg3 %>%
  group_by(class, manufacturer, model) %>%
  # some other calculation
  ungroup()
  
```

You know when you repeat something three times your supposed to write a function. But you haven't totally figured out how to program with dplyr yet, and in any case its not obvious that you really have a function worth factoring out. Instead of writing a function, you can instead replace just the repeated set of `group_by` variables.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("rlang"))

group_vars <- syms(c("class", "manufacturer", "model"))

mpg2 <- mpg %>%
  group_by(!!!group_vars) %>%
  mutate(max_cty = max(cty),
         max_hwy = max(hwy)) %>%
  ungroup()

# ....

mpg3 <- mpg2 %>%
  group_by(!!!group_vars) %>%
  mutate(mpg_ratio = hwy / cty) %>%
  ungroup()

# ...

mpg4 <- mpg3 %>%
  group_by(!!!group_vars) %>%
  # some other calculation
  ungroup()
```

Now if you need to change the grouping variables, you only have to do it in one place. Also, this is a big step towards writing that function.


## 3) Switch the Analysis Variables in a Shiny App, with Quasi-Quotation

Shiny apps used for exploratory plotting commonly want to take the name of variables from the user, and be able to make plots cut by that inputs. Shiny inputs will give a string, which can be turned into a symbol with `sym` and then used in your `dplyr` analysis with `!!`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# app.R - a simple one-fil app
library("tidyverse")

ui <- bootstrapPage(
  selectInput("group_var", "Group variable", choices = c("manufacturer", "model", "displ", "class") ),
  plotOutput('plot')
)


# Define the server code
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    group_var <- input$group_var %>% sym()
    
    df <- mpg %>%
      group_by(!!group_var) %>%
      summarize(cty = mean(cty),
                hwy = mean(hwy)) 
    
    ggplot(df, aes_string(x = "cty", y = "hwy", label = input$group_var)) +
      geom_text()
  })
}

# Return a Shiny app object
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Right now you need to use `!!` for `dplyr`/`tidyr` whereas `ggplot2` uses `aes_` and `aes_string`. My understanding is that ggplot2 will also be switchinig over to the rlang quasi-quotation system at some point as well.

**TODO: Put this on shinyapps.io or Digital Ocean**

## 5) Write Custom Higher-Order Functions (!?!), With Quasi-Quotation

Quasi-quotation tools are great for writing higher-order functions. As a warm-up, let's write a basic version of the `map` function that evaluates an expression.

```{r eval=FALSE}
basic_map <- function(.x, .f) {
  .f <- as_function(.f)
}
```
