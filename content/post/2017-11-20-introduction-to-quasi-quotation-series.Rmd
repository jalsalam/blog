Recently I have been spending time reading the [draft chapters](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/expressions) in the 2nd Edition Advanced-R book by Hadley Wickham -- specifically the chapters about Expressions, Quotation, Evaluation, and Domain-Specific Languages. These chapters accompany new quasi-quotation and tidy evaluation tools provided in the `rlang` package. I am really excited about these tools. I think they will be very useful for programming with dplyr and shiny, making higher-order functions, and I am excited to try out domain-specific language techniques. I have also read some skepticism about them being too complicated or difficult to understand, and so I wanted to make my own attempt to show why they are worth learning.

About Me:

As a caveat, I am no expert. I've been using R for 2 years, but haven't written lots of functions using these quotatino tools or anything. I have taught myself a lot about them in writing these posts, in fact! If you want the authoritative version, check out the vignette on [programming in dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html) and Advanced-R.

Who Quasi-Quotation is For:

There has been discussion about whether quasi-quotation and tidy evaluation tools are more for package authors than they are for people just trying to do some data wrangling. For me, understanding quasi-quotation has corresponded to a deeper understanding of how R works. This has been fun and valuable for me. That said, I understand that may sound daunting to some people. I would recommend learning quasi-quotation to people who are already very comfortable writing functions and using the 


_This post is one of a series of posts that I am doing about expressions, quasi-quotation, and tidy evaluation. This post tries to establish a mental model for quasi-quotation. The [companion post](/posts/2017/quasi-quotation-applications/) shows some useful things you can actually do with these tools._

_The R language has a powerful set of features for manipulating expressions which has recently been extended by the tidyverse team in the rlang package. I am really excited about the power and generality of quasi-quotation, especially in the realms of higher-order functions and creating unique function APIs. That said, I would recommend R users feel very comfortable with functions and functional programming (e.g., `apply` and/or `map` families of functions) before attempting quasi-quotation._
