<p><em>This post is one of a series of posts that I am doing about expressions, quasi-quotation, and tidy evaluation. This post shows some useful things you can actually do with these tools without attempting to explain what’s going on. The companion post tries to establish a mental model for quasi-quotation by analogy to a meta-recipe for cake.</em></p>
<p><em>The R language has a powerful set of features for manipulating expressions which has recently been extended by the tidyverse team in the rlang package. I am really excited about the power and generality of quasi-quotation, especially in the realms of higher-order functions and creating unique function APIs. That said, I would recommend R users feel very comfortable with functions and functional programming (e.g., <code>apply</code> and/or <code>map</code> families of functions) before attempting quasi-quotation.</em></p>
<p>So you’ve already made an initial attempt to learn quasi-quotation/tidy evaluation, and the hill to understanding these tools still looks high. You are asking “why bother?”, and tempted to just stick with what you know until forced, kicking-and-screaming to do it the “new way.” In the following I will try to provide some quick wins and also show a taste of the power of quasi-quotation.</p>

<h2>Recode LOTS of values, with Quasi-Quotation</h2>
<p>Say you are doing some data cleaning and you decide to try out <a href="http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/recode.html"><code>dplyr::recode</code></a>. The examples in the documentation give a plausible way to change a couple of values:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Recode values with named arguments
x &lt;- sample(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), 10, replace = TRUE)
dplyr::recode(x, a = &quot;Apple&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;Apple&quot; &quot;Apple&quot; &quot;c&quot;     &quot;b&quot;     &quot;c&quot;     &quot;c&quot;     &quot;c&quot;     &quot;c&quot;    
##  [9] &quot;b&quot;     &quot;b&quot;</code></pre>
<p>But wait – do you really have to manually type in EVERY value that you want to replace?!?! Nope. You need to create a named list, and then use the <code>!!!</code> operator (pronounced ‘bang bang bang’ or unquote-splice).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fruits &lt;- list(&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Carrot&quot;)
fruit_lookup &lt;- set_names(fruits, c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;))

recode(x, !!!fruit_lookup)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;Apple&quot;  &quot;Apple&quot;  &quot;Carrot&quot; &quot;Banana&quot; &quot;Carrot&quot; &quot;Carrot&quot; &quot;Carrot&quot;
##  [8] &quot;Carrot&quot; &quot;Banana&quot; &quot;Banana&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
